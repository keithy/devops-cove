## Usage

DevOps-Cove consists of a series of templates used internally within private github.com
hosted enterprise organisations (The Country). These are packaged as git submodules, that may be
selectively transposed, into the internal organisation.

From there the 'DevOps-Cove' instance within each organisation is a fork used by the maintainers (The Navy)
to work on the entire eco-system as a coherent whole. The Navy's role is to implement the will of
The DevOps Manager, and their fellow Lords and Ladies at executive level. Everything is carried out under
the watchful eye of Customs & Excise (InfoSec), to protect the Kingdom no less.

## Ports

Within the cove there are a number of ports, also available as templates. Different ports specialise in
different fare. Each local Lord or Lady (head of department) can select the ports for their department,
and determine who has access to work there.

## Harbour-Master

The harbour-master maintains a shared library of workflows that individual ports may subscribe to. 
Most usually each port will adopt one or more watchman. A watchman is a workflow that monitors the port
for changes and triggers activities. Different watchmen specialise in different activities.
